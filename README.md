# Chatbot-using-NLP-and-ML

Before executing the program on your machine, make sure your virtual environment has the below libraries installed 
1. pip install langdetect (to detect the language)
2. pip install google_trans_new (to translate the sentences into the desired language)
3. pip install speechrecognition (so that the machine recognizes your voice)
4. pip install transformers torch sentencepiece (to perform sentiment analysis)
5. pip install pyaudio 
6. pip install PyQt5 (for user interface)
7. pip install iso-639

In case if the pyaudio doesnt work in pycharm, do the following installation:
1. pip install pipwin
2. pipwin install pyaudio

The whole code runs effortlessly on PyCharm IDE 
It will take some time when you will select 'speech' option as it takes time to process and display the audio. 

If the code doesnt directly run then I refer you to do it directly using Terminal, just type "python ChatBox.py"
